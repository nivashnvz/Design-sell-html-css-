            <div><h1>Short descrition</h1>
                <pre>When the first Royal Enfield motorcycle rolled out in 1901, it was the beginning of an endearing story that would 
                    turn into a legend by the turn of the century. Aptly christened - Made Like a Gun - the phrase epitomize the simple,
                     resilient and dependable machines that have stood the test of time and terrain. It continues to be one of the key 
                     inspirations for everything that Royal Enfield builds.</pre>

            <div><h1>Our Vision</h1>
                <pre>Royal Enfield's objective is to disrupt the existing status quo by creating a new category in motorcycling globally -
                     one that heralds a return to fun and evocative mid-size motorcycling (where motorcycling refers to owning, riding, 
                     caring for, and living with a motorcycle).</pre>
            </div>
            <div><h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <pre>The British roots of Royal Enfield got an Indian soul in 1955, when Madras Motors started manufacturing the motorcycles
                     in Chennai. Six decades later, it has led the leisure motorcycling culture in India from the front. The iconic 
                     motorcycles have been accomplices to a thousand adventures and the dependable steed of the men in uniform. The upbeat 
                     response to the latest models is testimony to the fact that motorcycles are still trusted, loved and rode upon.</pre>
